## tic-tac-toe-project
This is a school project where I implemented a tic-tac-toe game that can be either player vs player or player vs computer. 
Main.c is the only code file for it apart from standard libraries. A terminal version of the game can be played after compiling and running main.c.
In report.pdf, I explained the two major features - computer player and input validation of the program, together with some flow charts, test cases and a list of advanced technique employed, such as dynamic programming and depth-first-search.
